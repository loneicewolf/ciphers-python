# ciphers-python #

Cipher encryption algorithms implemented in Python3 using Jupyter Notebooks!

Key words: Cypher, Cipher, Cyphers, Ciphers, cryptography, encryption, obfuscation, enciphering, deciphering  - in python3



**Purpose of this git:**

**Try to re-create some historic. Used ciphers, and slowly working them up to advanced, today-used crypto.** 
**For example; S-boxes in today's encryption algorithms; and P-boxes, (both used in so-called SP-Networks)**

a S-Box can be thought of a Substitution cipher. like Caesar. (Example below): abc -> def.

Or, another example of 1 simple (extremely simplified, I should add) can be a Alphabetical Substitution:

Instead of the normal alphabet (a-z); abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.

You use (in your Cipher) a permuted, totally mixed up alphabet: uijaopqvwbghklmncxydefszrt

A few test-rounds, to give you the idea..

**Normal alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz**
**Mixed alphabet: uijaopqvwbghklmncxydefszrt**

**Normal alphabet shifted with 3: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz -> defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc**

**Mixed alphabet shifted with 3: uijaopqvwbghklmncxydefszrt -> aopqvwbghklmncxydefszrtuij**

**Enciphering the message "abc" with mixed alphabet, shift 5: abc -> wmf**

*These kind of, working-up examples & projects I am right now doing.*
*And, this will be a sub-project, which will be used in my publications. On my website.*
*Go check it out, if you want!*
