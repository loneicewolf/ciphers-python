# ciphers-python 
Cipher encryption algorithms implemented in Python3 using Jupyter Notebooks!

Key words: Cypher, Cipher, Cyphers, Ciphers, cryptography, encryption, obfuscation, enciphering, deciphering  - in python3



**Purpose of this git:

**Try to re-create some historic. Used ciphers, and slowly working them up to advanced, today-used crypto. **for example; S-boxes in today's encryption algorithms; and P-boxes, (both used in so-called SP-Networks)

a S-Box can be thought of a Substitution cipher. like Caesar. (example below): abc -> def

or, another example of 1 simple (extremely simplified, I should add) can be a Alphabetical Substitution:

Instead of the normal alphabet (a-z); abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

you use (in your Cipher) a permuted, totally mixed up alphabet: uijaopqvwbghklmncxydefszrt

A few test-rounds, to give you the idea..

**normal alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz **mixed alphabet: uijaopqvwbghklmncxydefszrt

**normal alphabet shifted with 3: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz -> defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc

**mixed alphabet shifted with 3: uijaopqvwbghklmncxydefszrt -> aopqvwbghklmncxydefszrtuij

**enciphering the message "abc" with mixed alphabet, shift 5: abc -> wmf

These kind of, working-up examples & projects I am right now doing.

And, this will be a sub-project, which will be used in my publications, on my website. Go check it out, if you want!
